This is a concept of **bulletproof web applications**. Web is not perfect. Web is far from perfect. Web is broken: Cookies, Clickjacking, Frame navigation, CSRF,  links..

OriginMap **splits** the entire website into many pages with unique origins. Every page has its own Origin in terms of frame navigation - you simply cannot `window.open/<iframe>` to extract `document.body.innerHTML` because of CSP: Sandbox. 

Also every page contains additional `OriginMapObject` in `<meta>` tag, and sends it along with every `XMLHttpRequest` and `<form>` submission. 

`OriginMapObject` has `url` property - current page URL (not `location.href` which can be changed with history.pushState), `perms` - permissions granted for this page and `params` - restricting specific params values to simplify server-side business logic.

## OriginMap: Next level of XSS protection
The idea I'm implementing prototype of is to make every page **independent and secure** from others, probably vulnerable pages located on the same domain. 

When we find XSS at `/some_path` we do requests and read responses from anywhere on the whole website on this domain. 

XSS on `/about`, which is just a static page not using server side at all **leads to stolen money on `/withdraw`.**

**This is wrong.**

I want to change the current situation by adding *Authorization technology* for pages. Every page will have it's own unique origin and will serve such header:
```
Content-Security-Policy: sandbox;
```
this will disallow hacked `/some_path` to extract content from `/secret` and make requests on other endpoints.

Implementations of the concept can be different, for example we can add such meta tag to `<head>`, just like Rails adds csrf tokens
```
<meta name="permissions" content="following,edit_account,new_status--SIGNATURE">
```
Where SIGNATURE is HMAC, signed same way as Rails cookie.
With each request server side will check something like `if current_page_permissions.include?(:following)` or with more handy DSL.

This will dramatically improve complex website security, which are used to be pwned by ridiculously simple XSSes on static pages or external libraries' vulnerabilities. 

XSS at /some_path will be basically **useless** if this /some_path has no granted permissions.

## Content Security Policy
OriginMap takes adventadge of it. But CSP on itself is not panacea from XSS, here is why...

## OriginMap advantadges:
...

## Types of OriginMap

* URL-based
* Permissions-based
* Signed params-based

## OriginMap as view-based business logic.
Here is the sweet part: this can change the way you write business logic. Template can look like this:
```
form_for(current_user)
  -om_perms[:users] << current_user.id
  -for website in current_user.websites 
    edit website..
    -om_perms[:websites] << website.id
```
This will generate such origin map:
```
{
	url: "/update_account",
	perms: {
    users: [3532],
    websites: [345,346,348] 
  }
}
```
The map allows user to update **only** User with 3532 id and websites with id in (345,346,348). No server side validation is needed anymore - OM is signed with private key and user cannot tamper given map with permitted ids.

The whole concept is under heavy development, as well as rack prototype. Please share your thoughts at homakov@gmail.com.
